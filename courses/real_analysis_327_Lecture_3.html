Lecture 3: Supremum

Def: We say that S is bounded above by M (ie M is an upper bound for S) if \forall x \in S, x \leq M

A set bounded above admits many upper bounds. We are usually interested in the least upper bound. 

Assume S is bounded above. Then by the completeness axiom, if S is not empty, then S has a least upper bound (= supremum).

The defining properties of the supremum:
<ol>
<li> L = sup S \iff L is an upper bound for S </li>
<li> L = sup S \iff \forall M \in \mathbb{R}, if M is an upper bound for S, then L \leq M. </li>
</ol>



<p> In Lecture 2, we proved the following characterization: 

\[ L = sup S \iff
  \begin{cases}
    \forall x \in S, x \leq L \\
    \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists x \in S such that L - \epsilon < x \\
  \end{cases}
\]

Def: an open interval (a, b), for a, b \in \mathbb{R}, a < b is that the set (a, b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}, a < x < b \}

An open interval does not include it's end points. 

Def: a closed interval [a, b], for a, b \in \mathbb{R}, a < b is that the set (a, b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}, a \leq x \leq b \}

We can also have half-closed, half open intervals: 
<ul>
<li> [a, b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}, a \leq x < b \} </li>
<li> (a, b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R}, a < x \leq b \} </li>
</ul>

Example: S = (0, 1), 1 \notin S so we can show sup S = 1.

Definition: S is bounded below by m \in \mathbb{R} if \forall x \in S, m \leq x.

Definition: S, bounded below, admits a greatest lower bound (aka GLB or infinum), if there exists l such that:
<ol>
<li> l is a lower bound for S </li>
<li> \forall m \in \mathbb{R} that are lower bounds of S, m \leq l </li>
</ol>

Remember, by the completeness axiom, every S \neq \empty bounded above admits a supremum. 

Theorem: every S \subset \mathbb{R}, S \neq \empty bounded below, admits a greatest lower bound or infinum. 

Let's prove this using a reflection argument.  

Proof:

Let S \subset \mathbb{R}, S \neq \empty, bounded below. 

Define S' = {-x, x\in S}

Claim: S' is bounded above.

Let m be a lower bound for S. Then \forall x \in S, m \leq x \iff -x \leq -m
This means: \forall x' \in S', x' \leq -m \implies -m is an upper bound for S'.
By the completeness axiom, S' has an infinum, called L. 

Claim: -L = inf S = G.L.B S since L = L.U.B S' then:
<ol>
	<li>\forall x \in S', x \leq L</li>
	<li>\forall M, U.B of S', L \leq M</li>
</ol> 

Let x \in S. Then -x \in S', so by (1) -x \leq L \iff -L \leq x.
So \forall x \in S, -L \leq x. -L is a lower bound of S. 

Let m be a lower bound for S. Claim: m \leq -L

m is a lower bound for S \iff \forall x \in S, m \leq X \iff -m \geq -x \iff \forall x' \in S', x' \leq -m.
So -m is an upper bound for S', since L = L.U.B(S')
so L \leq -m \iff m \leq -L. \blackbox

We can derive everything about lower bounds based on stuff about upper bounds.
