<h2> New York, NY: April 26, 2012 </h2>
<h3> A response to attending an opera for Columbia's Music Humanities core requirement </h3>
<p> The night before I went to the opera, a friend asked me to attend her violin performance in one of the student lounges.  I joined the small, pajama-clad audience and listened.  In the background, people slammed doors, laundry machines rumbled, and phones rang.  At the end, we clapped, and then went our separate ways, without much discussion; the entire affair lasted forty minutes.  By contrast, the next night, I went to an opera, Manon, at the Met.  It was a full house, and if anyone talked during the performance, he or she was immediately told to be quiet.  There is no doubt that the setting of live music fundamentally changes our relationship to it.  The experience of going to the opera involves preparation, formality, a respected setting, and evaluation of the opera with other audience members.  All of these aspects undoubtedly affect our perception of the music. </p>

<p> Manon is a French opera, composed by Jules Massenet at the end of the nineteenth century.  At the beginning, we meet Manon, a girl who is engrossed by material pleasures, en-route to join a convent.  A young man, le Chevalier des Grieux, upon viewing Manon, is overcome by her beauty, and whisks her away to Paris.  Neither family approves, so they collaborate to tear the young couple apart.  Some years later, Manon is living with a wealthy gentleman and enjoying a luxurious vacation. By chance she encounters des Grieux’s father, and he tells her that his son has decided to join the church.  Manon is curious to see if he still loves her, so she visits him.  At first, he resists his suppressed feelings, but he finally admits that he still cares for her and they run away together.  As their money dwindles away, Manon asks des Grieux to gamble.  Although des Grieux wins, they are both arrested under the supposition that he must have cheated; however, only Manon is sent to jail.  One evening, des Grieux rescues her, but Manon is ill and dies in his arms, professing her love.  </p>

<p> For me, the experience of ‘going to the opera’ began even before setting foot in the Met.  In fact, it began when I started getting ready two hours prior to the performance.  The necessary preparation undoubtedly adds to the anticipation and enjoyment of the event.  While I would not dress up to listen to a recording of an opera, the live opera requires me to consider how I wish to present myself for the “unique” nature of the occasion.  Thus, the experience of listening to music gains a social dimension, which inevitably alters one’s perception of the opera.  It is certainly a modern bias that I am used to listening to musical recordings.  However, in the past, there were no recordings and thus a musical performance would have been an exclusively in-person event.  </p>

<p> In addition to the social aspect, a live experience also entails a specific venue.  Just as dressing up adds to the concept of formality, so too does the architecture of the Metropolitan Opera add to the aura of haute-culture.  An apt analogy is perhaps putting an ornate frame around a piece of art.  The painting would be impressive if it hung without a frame, but the extra ornamentation seems to lend further validation.  Similarly, the opera, even if performed in a high school gymnasium, would undoubtedly be impressive.  However, because it is performed at the Met, we know that it is deemed worthy of recognition by a highly-regarded artistic institution.  Something special awaits us behind that large red curtain.    </p>

<p> Personally, I did not find the first act of Manon to be particularly appealing.  There seemed to be very little character development and the performers did not sing anything that was show-stopping.  Actually, I thought that the plot line in the first act detracted somewhat from the music.  Le Chevalier des Grieux enters the scene about thirty minutes into the opera, has one glimpse of Manon, and immediately claims that he wants to marry her.  Although the singing was undoubtedly skillful, it seemed as though the performers were holding back and saving their voices.  This is hardly surprising, since they certainly had a demanding task ahead of them: a four-hour-long performance.   </p>
<p> I was fortunate to have a seat in the center, only one level up from the orchestra seating.  Nevertheless, I still needed opera glasses in order to discern staging details and the performers’ facial expressions.  In one way, the opera glasses distanced me from the music, presenting a barrier to the experience.  Conversely, by having the means to focus on individual details, it also provided me with an enhanced awareness of performance intricacies.</p>
<p> As the plot thickened, the second act became much more interesting.  The audience could feel more tension, since both Manon and her lover have uprooted themselves and fled to Paris against the wishes of their families.  For me, the drama added to the enjoyment of the music and seemed to tap into the underlying emotion of the plot.  Whereas in the first act, it seemed superficial for des Grieux to immediately fall in love, his passion is much more believable in the second act.  Additionally, Anna Netrebko, who plays Manon, has her first, truly emotional solo.  Her voice amazingly portrayed her pain and longing as she was torn between her love and her family. After a particularly beautiful aria, there is something extremely cathartic about clapping enthusiastically.  It would seem ridiculous to clap for a tape recording of an opera, but the live performance affords an opportunity to interact with the performers and other audience members through this simple expression of gratitude and listening pleasure.</p>
<p> The first intermission was at the end of the second act, and as soon as the curtain closed, the person sitting next to me leaned over to ask what I thought.  I would be asked this question three more times over the course of the evening.  Perhaps I felt self-conscious, but the question seemed to require more on my part than just “I liked it.”  My evaluation of the opera would somehow reflect my intelligence or cultural socialization.  In fact, at the Met, I don't think the only performers were on stage.  The audience puts on a performance as well by dressing up and signaling levels of sophistication via conversation with other audience members.  I heard some say that they loved it, that it was the best opera of the season.  Others claimed that the Met had permanently marred Manon.</p>
<p> Before the start of the third act, a spotlight shone on the conductor as he entered the orchestra pit.  The spotlight perhaps confirms his importance to the coherence of the opera; he is, after all, the guiding force of the orchestra.  As I watched him throughout the opera, I realized how the production of music can be emotionally and physically taxing.  When listening to a recording, one only hears the sound and definitely loses an appreciation of the physical work required.  </p>
<p> However, although the conductor is important, the true star of the performance was undoubtedly Anna Netrebko.  In the third act, she literally sings to a crowd of admirers who congregate to admire her beauty.  She is the only stand-out female vocalist on stage, and, visually, her costumes distinguish her from the crowd and the set.  Even before the performance, the audience knows that Netrebko is the main attraction, since her face is on the programs, tickets, and banners outside of the opera hall.  For me, it added to the anticipation, knowing that it was a thrilling and unique opportunity to see her in a live performance at the Met. </p> 
<p> In class, Brad observed that Gregorian monks and rock stars have a fundamentally different relationship to music.  The monks use music to exalt an otherworldly force, whereas the rock stars showcase their talent through spectacle. The rock stars express their emotions, without regard to convention, whereas the monks have a very specific structure for their Mass.  It seems like the opera singers probably fall somewhere between the rock stars and the monks. On one hand, the opera singers are certainly expressing emotion and putting on a spectacle.  At the end of the third act, Manon travels to reclaim des Grieux from the abbey.  They both deliver powerful performances about the strength and nature of their love, and the scene closes with Manon ripping off des Grieux’s shirt.  This aspect of the performance is clearly for the entertainment of the audience and for the purpose of show.  However, the structure of the performance holds a certain amount of predictability.  Manon is a comédie tragique, so we know that there will be tragedy.  There are certain themes that were probably considered ‘proper’ subject matter by the social and intellectual elite of Paris. </p> 
<p> In the opening to the fifth act, Manon has met her downfall.  The orchestration is extremely gloomy, making it quite clear that there is no hope for redemption; similar to La Traviata, the idea of ‘the fallen woman’ is expressed through music.   The death of Manon takes at least twenty minutes, and, although the scene is quite moving, at that point the audience has been there for four hours.  Once she dies, the curtain closes quickly and dramatically. </p> 
<p> Overall, I enjoyed the performance.  Going to an opera is an experience centered around individual and social appreciation of a musical performance.  On an individual level, I could appreciate the tradition of the music.  Knowledge of how an opera is constructed certainly added to the experience for me.  I could identify arias and compare the music to other operas that we have studied in class.  On a social level, it was very interesting to see how people interacted in the context of a musical centerpiece.  I also think that listening to a performance for an extended period of time forced me to reflect on its themes and to appreciate music in a new way.   Certainly, the opera gave me an appreciation of the potential to express a fundamental emotion that transcends understanding; afterwards, we try to convey a similar level of emotional clairvoyance through our evaluation, but surely fall short.</p>
