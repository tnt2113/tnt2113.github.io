  <h1 class="post-title">On learning to code </h1>
<p> A few people interested in working at IHME have asked me for advice on learning to code. These questions include:
<ul>

<li>Which coding language do you think it would be most useful for me to learn? </li>
<li>Do I need to take a class to learn to program?  </li>
<li>Do I need to have a background in Computer Science/Math/Statistics/Data Science/Name-your-scary-sounding-thing to learn how to code? </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>At the risk of generalizing my own experience to advice, I&#39m happy to point folks to resources. I think it can look like people who program do so magically, calling upon some unbridled genius that is then channeled write <font face="Courier New" color="red">import glob as glob</font> or whatever. It&#39s not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(programming)">magic</a>, it just takes a certain thought process and lots of practice. 
<p>I avoided coding completely in high school and most of college.  The turning point for me was learning Stata in my Introductory Econometrics class. It was the first time programming felt like it had a purpose. After graduating from college, my first full-time job involved coding 100% of the time. One learns a lot about &#34how programming works&#34 and the software engineering side of programming over the course of this. One learns about why loops are important, why reproducible work is awesome, and <a href = "http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745" > good coding practices for scientific computing.  </a> </p> 
<p> There were few formal trainings, other than many hours searching the internet and asking for help. The internet has all of the answers. Talking to other people can also be a great way to go. 
The best way to learn how to code is to take the plunge. You donâ€™t need a background in Something-Terrifying. I personally just needed a motivating project, and lots of example code. </p>
